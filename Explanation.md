explanation

## History:

C++ was invented in 1979 as a step up from C. It was invented to support object-oriented programming.

## Why is C++ Good For Game Development?
### Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming is ideal for game development for three main reasons:
1. It creates reusable code.
2. It is intuitive for the developer. You can translate real-world objects and interactions into code by definition. 
3. It’s key features, which are:
	+ Cohesion - Every element, whether it’s a variable, function, or class, should only be responsible for one task.
		 
		For example, our main function,
		```

		int main() {

    	Game g;

    	g.play();
    
		}
		```
		is only responsible for running the `play()` function. 		This way, we do not clutter up our `main` function with 		definitions, especially if we are calling more than 		one.
