# README

This repository contains the materials of my final project.

For this project, I decided to explore C++ from a game development standpoint. 

I have implemented a C++ game, a walkthrough tutorial, and a document of my research on the subject.

## Components of This Repository
```
Tutorial
	main.cpp
	Tutorial.h
	Tutorial.cpp
	Game.h
	Game.cpp
	README.md
ResearchDoc.md
README.md
```

The ```Tutorial``` folder contains my C++ game as well as the walkthrough. The game is demonstrated at the end of the tutorial. 

Please finish the tutorial before viewing ```ResearchDoc.md```.
